\section{Contribution}

In this thesis we achieved the following results.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed a new, semi-automated methodology to support system design
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Defined a multi-phase workflow to implement this methodology.
		\item Defined formalisms for declarative requirement types for corresponding outputs, valid and invalid traces, sequence diagrams and LTL expressions.
		\item Enabled refinement-based requirement specification by introducing conflict handling among conflicting requirements.
		\item Proposed solution to the infeasibility of equivalence validation.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Designed an architecture to support the proposed methodology
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Created the approach of adaptive learning using heuristics to determine inferable information.
		\item Reconciled different modeling formalisms using an automata theory based approach.
		\item Designed an adaptive variant of the Direct Hypothesis Construction algorithm.
		\item Introduced caching to tackle the ineffectiveness of automatized information extraction.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Created a proof of concept implementation of the proposed architecture in order to validate our approach.
	\item Demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of the implementation and the approach through a case study.
	\item Evaluated the components of the implementation.
\end{itemize}
